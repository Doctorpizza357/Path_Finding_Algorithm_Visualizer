# Grid Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a Java Swing GUI application for visualizing the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid.

## Features

- Visualizes the A* pathfinding algorithm in real-time.
- Allows the user to place the start and end points on the grid.
- Supports adding barriers by left-clicking on grid cells.
- Supports removing barriers by right-clicking on grid cells.
- Provides an option to generate a random maze.
- Offers a reset option after visualization is complete.

## How to Use

1. Run the application.
2. Left-click on a grid cell to place the start point (shown in blue).
3. Left-click on another grid cell to place the end point (shown in red).
4. Left-click on additional grid cells to add barriers (shown in black).
5. Press the 's' key to start the A* algorithm visualization.
6. Press the 'g' key to generate a random maze.
7. press the 'L' key to load maze from screenshot
8. press the 'r' key to reset the maze
